## Legacy of the Dragonborn Additional Modifications
- #### [Quest and Reward Delay for Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44923) - Delays the various rewards and quests in Legacy of the Dragonborn to higher display count numbers.
   > NOTE (IMPORTANT): This mod is already a part of Septimus 3, yet comes in two versions: "LOTD Delay Patch" & "LOTD Extra Delay Patch". We are going to be using the "Extra Delay" version of this mod due to the drastic increase of possible displays for the museum. You do not need to download this mod in the installation guide if you do not want to. The "Extra Delay" version doubles the number of required displays. For the final LOTD quest in this version, you need **2700** displays in the museum. This mod is for players who want a 200+ hour playthrough, not those who want to blow through Legacy of the Dragonborn's content and not for first time LOTD players.

- #### [Complete Replica Fixes for Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46575/) - This mod adds replicas and/or the recipes to craft them for every item that is able to be displayed in Deepholme, so you can store all your originals safely away, and have a second space that is chronically underfilled.
- #### [Fate Card Packs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47884/) - An addon for LOTD. This mod adds packs of random Fate Cards to vendors. Yes, gambling is now in Skyrim as well!
